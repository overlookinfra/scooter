      # This class is designed to interact with any of the pe-console-services:
      # RBAC, Node Classifier, and the Activity Service. The most common use
      # case will be for tests executed with beaker, for which you will want
      # to pass in the dashboard for initialization. The other parameter that
      # you can pass in optionally is credentials, if you wish to get a web
      # session and use that to talk to various other parts of PE.
      #
      # If you are using this class outside of beaker, you can initialize an
      # object without any parameters and supply your own dashboard as a String,
      # credentials, Faraday connection object, and ssl parameters. Note that
      # this is largely untested. Use outside of a Beaker test run at your own
      # risk.
